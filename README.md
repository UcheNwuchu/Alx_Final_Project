# **Willy Blog**

**Willy Blog** is a full-stack blog platform built as part of the ALX final project. The platform allows users to create, edit, delete, and view blog posts. It also features user authentication, markdown support for creating posts, and image uploads for a rich user experience.

## **Features**
- User authentication (Sign up, Log in, Log out)
- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Track posts users have read
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Markdown editor for rich content creation
- Image upload for blog post headers

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT for session management
- **File Upload**: Multer (or Cloudinary)

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/willy-blog.git
   cd willy-blog
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set environment variables** in a `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
   JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret>
   ```

5. **Run the servers**:
   - **Backend**:  
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - **Frontend**:  
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

6. **Access the application**:

## **API Endpoints**
- **Authentication**:
  - `POST /auth/register` – Register a new user
  - `POST /auth/login` – Log in a user

- **Blog Posts**:
  - `GET /posts` – Get all blog posts
  - `POST /posts` – Create a new blog post

## **Challenges**
- Securing user authentication and data
